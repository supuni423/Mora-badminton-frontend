        <p>
          UMISF has been a long-standing event, spanning back to its inception in 2007. The tournament is carried out with the primary intention of providing a platform for badminton players to connect, compete, and hone their skills. Teams from India and Malaysia have participated in UMISF in 2011, marking a milestone in the history of university sports. For over a decade we were able to conduct this tournament successfully with the participation of 1000+ players in most of the years. In 2024, we proudly expanded our horizons by introducing Novices men's badminton championship to the tournament and we're confident that this year's events will be a huge success too.

        <h1>Messages From The Organizing Committee</h1>
        <p>
          Badminton has always been a popular sport among the undergraduate
          community of our university. Since the inauguration of this annual
          tournament in 2007, we have expanded our horizons. It was indeed a
          success for us to reach the 1000 plus mark in the number of
          participants. UMiSF is a great platform to show out the potential of
          youngsters, university students, university staff members, as well as
          corporates. We wish the participants the best of luck for the
          tournament and hope everyone will enjoy it.
